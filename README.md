Robotics using an Arduino Nano

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to learn to drive servo motors from an Arduino. I'll be using a (Chinese) Arduino Nano and a Mr. General (My first robot) robot.

## Log
1. Installed Arduino IDE v1.6.8
2. Need to install a USB serial driver for the Nano's *CH340* Usb-to-serial chip. [see reference](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/17358)
